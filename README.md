# Virtual-Mouse 
# Overview
The Virtual Mouse project is a hands-free computer interaction tool using hand gestures. It employs OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking, enabling cursor movement, clicks, and scrolling. This project is a step toward intuitive and accessible Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

# Features
- Real-Time Tracking: Smooth and accurate hand gesture recognition.
- Cursor Control: Move the cursor using hand gestures.
- Click Actions: Perform left and right clicks through gestures.
- Scrolling: Navigate pages using vertical hand movements.
- Accessibility: Provides a touchless alternative to traditional mouse devices.

# Installation
- Clone the Repository
- Create and Activate Virtual Environement
- Install Dependencies
- Run the Applications

# Usage
- Ensure your webcam is functioning and your hand is visible in the frame.
- Cursor Movement: Move your hand to control the cursor & Perform a pinch gesture with thumb and index finger.
- Scroll: Move your hand up or down with a closed fist.

# Configuration
- Sensitivity Adjustment: Modify sensitivity in the config.py file.
- Gesture Customization: Add or modify gestures in the gesture recognition module (utils/gestures.py).
- Camera Settings: Adjust resolution and frame rate in the virtual_mouse.py file.
